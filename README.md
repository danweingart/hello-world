# hello-world

My name is Daniel Weingart. I am looking to better my understanding of coding and software development by utilizing Github! When I was young, I learned standard HTML coding in order to post colored messages on Nickelodeon's message boards. I probably should have realized that coding would pique my interests as an adult as well, but ended up entering the field of financial/data analysis. Although I really enjoy my job, I am hoping I can re-discover my interest in coding and improve my technical skills.
